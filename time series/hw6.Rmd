```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Problem 3

```{r}
library(stats)
arma_acf=ARMAacf(ar=c(0.4,0.45),c(1,0.25),lag.max = 20)
arma_pacf=ARMAacf(ar=c(0.4,0.45),c(1,0.25),lag.max = 20,pacf = TRUE)
plot(arma_acf)
plot(arma_pacf)
```
## According to the plots, the ACF value is infinitely close to 0 as the lag order increases and the PACF value gradually smoothes out as the lag order increases
