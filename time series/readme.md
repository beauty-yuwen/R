# Time Series
## In this file, all the R work of time series is included. There are several homework and two projects.
### Introduction of time series
In time series we are concerned with data that is observed sequentially. The key issue is not that it is a time or date but rather that the observations are ordered. This order is part of our understanding of the underlying process, and should be part of our solution to questions about the process.

A second data feature of many time series applications is observations are equally spaced. If there are missing observations then we will generally impute these missing observations so that standard methods and softare apply. Solutions should be checked for sensitivity to the imputation.
