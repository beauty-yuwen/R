# Mltivariate Statistical Analysis
## In this file, all of the Mltivariate Statistical Analysis R work I did in my graduate study is included.
In many data collection scenarios, a large number of variables are collected for each observational unit. The main approach to analyze such data is dimension reduction. This course focuses on general methods and specific models and eschews algorithmic considerations in favor of the use of algorithms for data analysis. 
### Learn how to apply geometric methods to reduce dimension in Euclidean space.
### Learn how to apply dimention methods to raw data matrices and similarity matrices.
### Learn techniques for clustering and discriminations.
### Apply the methods learned in data analysis.
