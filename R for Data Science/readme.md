# R for Data Science
## Brief description of the course
In this introductory course students will learn how to work through data science problems within the statistical programming language R. The course covers R basics and intermediate (and some advance topics), the complete analytical process, from getting your data into R, to applying appropriate exploratory and statistical analysis, and communicating the results. Important topics in data science (e.g. databases, web scraping) and efficient programming are integrated throughout the course, time permitting.
